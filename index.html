Origami has always interested me: how complex 3d structures can be created by simple folds. 
I think space structures are some of the most complex structures our society creates, 
so I set out to research if Origami is being used in space development. I first had to understand
what challenges might stop origami from being used. I found that it is difficult to model origami
folds currently so there is limited use although there is a lot of interest in using origami for 
solar sails. Nasa is doing further research on modelling origami but did use some simple folding 
techniques on the James web telescope and Japan has had success using origami folds in their solar 
sails, and we will look at these in greater depth.

Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper; it is primarily used to create decorative pieces. Many people have seen, and some made, an origami crane. In approximately 20 folds you can turn a flat piece of paper into a complex crane. If you have attempted to make a crane, then you may have noticed that despite having strict instructions there is a degree of flexibility to each fold: no folds need to be perfect to obtain a recognisable crane. Paper and human creation allows for some error in each fold however if you where to use origami in space there needs to be no errors. To make sure that is possible we need to model the folds.
